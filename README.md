SystemSzwajcarski
More information about the Swiss tournament is available under the link: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament. In my programme, the organiser creates a tournament and sets its parameters. The organiser can manually add players or let the players join the tournament themselves. The organiser can create their own players with the option of logging in, or s/he can add players already registered by themselves. The tournament is played according to the rules of a Swiss tournament. The results of the rounds are entered by the organiser or the players. For the time being, players in subsequent rounds are paired according to the Dutch system.
